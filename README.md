________________
The project activity with title under UCR “2 MW Small Scale Wind Power Project by M/S Vijay
Mamra Pvt. Ltd.” (Herein after called as project proponent ‘PP’) in Patan district in the state of Gujarat
(India). The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being
applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of a single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 2 MW manufactured and
supplied by M/s Siemens Gamesa in district Patan of the state of Gujarat in India. This project has been
promoted by M/S Vijay Mamra Pvt. Ltd.
The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 28/03/2019 by the Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.

The project activity involves one wind turbine generator (WTG) having a capacity of 2 MW
manufactured and supplied by Siemens Gamesa. The average life of the generator is around 20 years
as per the equipment supplier’s specification. The other salient features of the technology are:
The wind turbine is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy of the wind. This is transformed
into electrical energy using wind turbines or wind energy conversion systems. Wind first hits a turbine’s
blades, causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them. That changes the kinetic energy
to rotational energy, by moving a shaft which is connected to a generator, and thereby producing
electrical energy through electromagnetism.

The duration of the crediting period corresponding to the monitoring period is covered in this monitoring
